DEhaveb v1.0
---------------------
Created by Joris "Interface" de Gruyter.
This Tool only decompiles scripts. I know some people
in the community are looking forward to the "big" tool
i'm making for advanced editing of scripts. I will wait
with that at least until the add-on has been released,
because there should be new commands in it. That
way my tool will have support for the new functions
as well. This decompiler will probably fail on some
compiled scripts from the add-on, but i'll fix it, don't
worry. If it fails on scripts from the current version of
EF, please send me the IBI file which gave the error!

This tool can be attached to the IBI format in Windows.
If you don't have any program assigned to IBI files yet,
double-click on an IBI file. It will prompt you to give it a
program. Just select the DEhaveb program and press
"ok". (it will not appear in the program list, you will have
to press "other" or "browse" depending on your operating
system) You're all set now. All IBI files will have the
"DE"-icon, and if you double-click on them, they will
open up in DEvaheb.

If you're wondering WHY the stupid name... My editing
tool will be called "BehaveS", a stupid joke on the original
tool, implying it behaved once, but mine still does.
This stupid name is another incredibly funny joke (*sigh*¨)
on the tool's name, it's just reversed, referring to
the reversed engineering it does on the scripts.


Thnx for the support i get.
